# Breast Classification using Neural Networks
Welcome to the repository for "Breast Classification using Neural Networks," a project dedicated to leveraging the power of neural networks for the classification of breast tissue in medical industry. This repository contains the code for implementing a sophisticated neural network model designed to aid in the accurate and efficient classification of breast tissue, which is crucial in the diagnosis and treatment of breast-related diseases.

### Project Overview
This project utilizes simple neural network architectures to classify breast tissue. The goal is to provide a reliable and efficient tool for medical professionals, aiding in the early detection and treatment planning of breast-related conditions.

### Key Features
Neural Network Architecture: The core of this project is a neural network designed to handle the complexities and nuances of breast tissue classification. The architecture is tailored to extract and learn from the intricate patterns.
Early Stopping: To enhance the efficiency of our model and prevent overfitting, I have incorporated an early stopping mechanism. This technique monitors the model's performance and halts the training process once the model ceases to show improvement, ensuring optimal performance.
Dropout Layers: My model includes dropout layers, which are crucial in reducing overfitting. These layers randomly deactivate a subset of neurons during the training process, promoting a more generalized and robust model that performs well on new, unseen data.
